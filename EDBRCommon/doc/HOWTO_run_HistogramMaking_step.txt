Instructions for making plots from the plain ROOT TTrees

=== GENERAL COMMENTS ===

*) The basic idea is to present the user a class,
EDBRHistoMaker, which analyzes a given TTree or TChain
and produces a set of histograms which are then saved
in a ROOT file. 

*) There is also another class,
EDBRHistoPlotter.h, which reads the histograms produced
by EDBRHistoMaker, stacks and normalizes the MC and plots
them together in a beautiful way.

*) The code is structured as a set of three files:
ExoDiBosonResonances/EDBRCommon/rootmacros/EDBRHistoMaker.h
ExoDiBosonResonances/EDBRCommon/rootmacros/EDBRHistoPlotter.h
ExoDiBosonResonances/EDBRCommon/rootmacros/loopPlot.C

*) EDBRHistoMaker.h file has the following itens:
   *) the structure of histograms which are created (numbers and edges of bins)
   *) the structure of the TTree analyzed (the list of variables, TBranches, 
   and the code to connect the TBranches)
   *) the declaration and definition of the functions for analysis - for instance, 
   there's a member function bool eventPassesCut(), which relies on member variables
   *) the definition of the regions (signal/sideband, electron/muon, etc.)
   *) more importantly, the definition of the Loop() function, which runs
   over the events on the TTree/TChain and fills the histograms
    
*) EDBRHistoPlotter.h has the following itens
   *) definition of the histogram colors
   *) definition of the legend and all the labels
   *) normalization options (kFactor, luminosity, or scaling to data)

*) loopPlot.C
   *) controls high-level flags and passes them to the histogram maker
   and histogram plotter objects
   *) loops over the list of files
   *) creates one instance of EDBRHistoMaker for EACH file
   *) creates one instance of EDBRHistoPlotter to plot files together
   *) additionally, one can skip the histogram making step to reuse
   the files previously made 

=== RUNNING ===

0) Define, in loopPlot.C, which high-level flags you want to set:
   *) electrons/muons, sideband/signal, single/double jet, ZZ/WW channel
   *) lumi, kFactor and scale to data or not
   *) if we should redo histogram or use the ones we already made
   *) trees location
   *) directory of the output plots
   *) names of the datasets

1) Start ROOT, with the file you want to analyze:

$ root -b

2) Load the macro:

[] .L loopPlot.C+

3) Execute the macro

[] loopPlot()
