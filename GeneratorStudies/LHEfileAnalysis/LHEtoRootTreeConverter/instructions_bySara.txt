================================
Hi,
as requested at the last meeting,
in attach you find the script and the macro to convert
a LHE (=LesHouches) file into a root tree.
You can use it like this:
./converter_digamma.sh input.lhe

The script converter_digamma.sh calls internally
the macro photonTree.C which reads the LHE file
and create the tree (input.root)

The code is now written for a gamma-gamma final state
but you can easily adapt it to any final state:
- you have to change this line:
awk '/<event>/,/LesHouchesEvents>/  .... > $ff
in the converter_digamma.sh putting only the PDG ID
you want actually to remove from the lhe file
(for instance you want to keep only the 4 final state fermions
and not all the MC history)
- you have to change accordingly the photonTree.C macro

hope it helps,
cheers
